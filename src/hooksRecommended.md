ST1 Backup Hooks - Are They Necessary?
Short Answer: Usually YES, but depends on your application
Why Hooks Matter More for ST1 (File-System Backup)
Volume Snapshots (GP2/GP3) vs File-System Backup (ST1)
AspectVolume SnapshotsFile-System Backup (ST1)Consistency MethodPoint-in-time snapshot (atomic)File-by-file copy (non-atomic)Backup TimeSeconds (instant snapshot)Minutes to hours (depends on data size)Data StateFrozen at snapshot momentLive data during backup processRiskLow - atomic operationHigher - files can change during backupHook NecessityNice-to-haveMore critical
ST1-Specific Risks Without Hooks
1. File Inconsistency
bash# During backup without hooks:
Time T0: victoria-logs writes "log entry A" to file
Time T1: Restic starts reading the file
Time T2: victoria-logs appends "log entry B" to same file  
Time T3: Restic finishes reading file
# Result: Backup may have partial writes or inconsistent state
2. Buffer/Cache Issues
bash# Without sync hooks:
- Application writes data to memory buffers
- OS hasn't flushed buffers to disk yet
- File-system backup reads old data from disk
- Recent writes are lost in backup
3. Transactional Inconsistency
bash# For databases or structured logs:
- Transaction starts: Write index entry
- File backup reads index (with new entry)
- Transaction continues: Write data file
- File backup reads data file (without new data)
- Result: Index points to non-existent data
Victoria Logs Specific Analysis
Victoria Logs Characteristics:

Log ingestion system - Continuously receiving and writing logs
Time-series data - Append-heavy workload
Indexing - Creates index files alongside data
Buffering - May buffer writes for performance
