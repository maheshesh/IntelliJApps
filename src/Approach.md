Summary of Helm-Based Approach:
1. Velero Installation via Helm:

Uses official VMware Tanzu Helm chart
Configured specifically for ST1 volumes (file-system backup)
Includes node-agent (Restic/Kopia) for file-system backups
Pre-configured scheduled backups

2. Victoria Logs Customization:

Add labels and annotations to your existing Victoria Logs Helm values
Automatic PVC labeling via post-install hooks
Backup-friendly pod annotations

3. Custom Backup Helm Chart (Optional):

Complete Helm chart for managing backups
Automated PVC labeling
Scheduled and manual backup templates
Restore configurations

4. Key Differences for ST1:

snapshotVolumes: false - No EBS snapshots
defaultVolumesToFsBackup: true - Use file-system backup
nodeAgent.enable: true - Required for file-system backups
No volume snapshot location configured

Usage:

Update variables in the deployment script with your AWS credentials and bucket info
Deploy Velero using the Helm values file
Label your 3 specific PVCs with velero.io/backup=enabled
Test backup with the provided commands
Optional: Deploy the custom backup chart for more advanced management

The Helm approach gives you full control over the configuration while maintaining the ability to upgrade and manage the deployment declaratively.
