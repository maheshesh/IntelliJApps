Platform-Specific Options
AWS EKS:

AWS Backup service for EBS volumes
EBS snapshots via AWS CLI/SDK
CSI snapshot controller with VolumeSnapshots

GKE:

Google Cloud Backup for GKE
Persistent disk snapshots
CSI snapshots

AKS:

Azure Backup service
Azure disk snapshots

Application-Level Backup (Recommended for VictoriaLogs)
Since you're using VictoriaLogs specifically, consider:

VictoriaLogs native backup:

Use VictoriaLogs' built-in backup functionality
Export data to object storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob)
More portable across clouds


Init container approach:
yamlapiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: victorialogs-backup
spec:
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: backup
            image: your-backup-image
            volumeMounts:
            - name: victorialogs-data
              mountPath: /data
            command:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - |
              # Rsync or tar to cloud storage
              tar czf /tmp/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /data
              aws s3 cp /tmp/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz s3://your-backup-bucket/
          volumes:
          - name: victorialogs-data
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: victorialogs-pvc


Multi-Cloud Strategy
For your future multi-cloud setup:

Standardize on Velero - Single tool across all clouds
Use object storage - Store backups in cloud-agnostic format
Implement GitOps - Keep configurations in Git for easy replication
Consider Helm charts - Standardize deployments across clouds

St1 Specific Considerations
Since you're using st1 (throughput optimized) volumes:

St1 volumes can't be used as boot volumes but work fine for data
Ensure backup jobs don't overwhelm the throughput limits
Consider scheduling backups during low-traffic periods
